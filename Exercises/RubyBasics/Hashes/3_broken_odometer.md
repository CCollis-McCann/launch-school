Using the following code, delete the key `:mileage` and its associated value from `car`.

```ruby
car = {
  type: 'sedan',
  color: 'blue',
  mileage: 80_000,
  year: 2003
}
```

Solution

```ruby
car.delete(:mileage)
```

Discussion

Removing a key, and its associated value, from a hash is fairly trivial with the `Hash#delete` method. When you call `#delete`, specify the key you want to delete and pass it in as an argument, like this `delete(key)`.
